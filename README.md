# assignment-cc

Assuming this to be an assessment and not a production ready requirement (coz it will be illegal to expect production ready code without paying and using interview candidate to get your job done ;-) just kidding).

I have included 2 integration tests, (vendor keeps calling to hurry so either give more time or be satisfied in this).

APIs:
1st GET with userId : gets transaction details of a particular userId
2nd GET : last n number of months of transaction details (ofcourse, extension and improvement is possible with params like userId, date etc) (again just an assignment focusing on programming logic not doing business).
3 POST: to register transaction.
